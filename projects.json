When the user loads the site the correct name is fetched from the database. Manages users' local storage for game state and statistics. Uses twitter intents to share completion of today's wordle-mon and displays a timer to show when the reset occurs. User is able to change to dark mode and it is fully functional on mobile view.",

Post to the discussion board about the temtem of the day and like or dislike others comments. Daily temtem changes every day. This was a challenging app to build as it was my first time using somone else's api. The api was incomplete which is why you see some missing renders. But it was a great learning experience. Used an open source API to display the characters in 3D with stat cards and custom pagination. Developed a custom API to change the daily character that users can guess and comment about. Corrected code for an open source API that mishandled information.",
